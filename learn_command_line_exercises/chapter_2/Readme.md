1.  I would run `pwd` and it would show me 
`/Users/AndySowar/workspace/davinci_coders_t2_2015/homework/learn_command_line_exercises`  
<br/>

2.  No. When I type `pwd`, the command line says `Users/AndySowar/workspace/davinci_coders_t2_2015/homework/learn_command_line_exercises`.
This is the `learn_command_line_exercises` directory in our homework folder.
<br/><br/>
    
3.  No, when I type `pwd`, the result is `Users/AndySowar/workspace/davinci_coders_t2_2015/homework/learn_command_line_exercises`.
This is the `learn_command_line_exercises` directory. To get to my home directory, I would type `cd ../../../../`. 
I would then type `pwd` again to verify.  
<br/>
4.  To find out what directory I typed that command in, I would type `pwd` into the command line. 
The result is `Users/AndySowar/workspace/davinci_coders_t2_2015/homework/learn_command_line_exercises`

5.  In a new finder window, I would click on the `AndySowar` icon on the far left.
I would then find the `workspace` folder and double click on it.
I would then find the `davinci_coders_t2_2015` folder and double click on it.
Next, I would find the `homework` folder and double click on it.
Finally, I would find the `learn_command_exercises_folder` and double click on it.
