###### 1. Describe what `ls -lR` does.

The `ls -lR` command lists all of the directories in the folder that you are currently in.

###### 2. What's in the tmp directory?

If I go into the tmp directory & type `ls` I will find out. It prints `stuff`.

###### 3. Can you show me what files are in that directory?

Yes, by typing `cd stuff` then `ls` I can find out.

###### 4. What files are in your home directory?

If I type `cd ~/` then `ls` I find a list of things in my home directory. This is what is in my home directory: `Applications	Library		Public
