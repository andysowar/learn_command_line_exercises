###### 1. Describe what `ls -lR` does.

`ls -lR` lists all of the subdirectories in your current directory. The `R` lists all of them recursively. 
###### 2. What's in the tmp directory?

By typing `ls tmp`, I can find out what is in the tmp directory from anywhere in Terminal.

###### 3. Can you show me what files are in that directory?

Yes, by typing `cd stuff` then `ls` I can find out.

###### 4. What files are in your home directory?

The command for this is `ls ~/` . This is what is in my home directory: `Applications	Library		Public
